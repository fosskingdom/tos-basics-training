### ✅ **Verified Gross Mass (VGM)**

* **What is it?**
  VGM means the total weight of a container, including the cargo, packaging, and container itself.
* **Why is it important?**
  To avoid overloading ships and prevent accidents during transportation.
* **Is it required?**
  Yes, it's a mandatory safety rule for all containers.

### ✅ **Unit vs. Container**

* **Unit**:
  A **unit** is a single piece of cargo that is handled on its own (like a machine, box, or item).
* **Container**:
  A **container** is a large box used to carry cargo. It’s treated like inventory unless it goes through a transaction.
* **Key Difference**:
  A container becomes a **unit** when it enters or leaves the terminal (i.e., during a transaction).

---

### ✅ **Transaction Cycle**

* **What is it?**
  The steps a container goes through when entering or leaving the terminal.
* **Why does it matter?**
  These steps change how the container is handled and tracked.
* **Result**:
  The container gets attributes like **category**, **visit state**, and **transit state** once it's considered a unit.

---

### ✅ **Attributes of a Unit**

* **Category**:
  Describes what type of cargo is inside (e.g., import, export, empty).
* **Visit State**:
  Tracks where the unit is in the terminal (e.g., just arrived, in the yard, or leaving).
* **Transit State**:
  Monitors the unit’s progress through different steps in the terminal.

---

### ✅ **Gate Configuration**

* **What is it?**
  How the terminal gate is set up to handle different steps when trucks enter or exit.
* **Stages**:

  * **Engaged Stage**: Truck is linked to a task.
  * **Pedestal Stage**: Check-in (license plate, documents).
  * **Yard Stage**: Moving containers in/out.
  * **Appointment Stage**: Pre-scheduled entry.
* **Transactions**:
  Actions like receiving cargo, delivering it, moving empty containers, or handling truck chassis.

---

### ✅ **Gate Operations**

* **Appointments**:
  Bookings made to bring in or take out containers. Helps avoid long queues.
* **Truck IDs**:
  Used to identify trucks. Helps in tracking and managing gate entry/exit.
* **Transactions**:
  Include container delivery, pickup, and returns. All of this is recorded and managed at the gate.

---

### ✅ **Turn Time (TT)**

* **What is it?**
  The time a truck spends inside the terminal (from entry to exit).
* **Why is it important?**
  Shorter turn times mean better terminal efficiency and faster service.

### ✅ **Simplified Meeting Summary – Terminal Operations**

| **Topic**                     | **Simple Explanation**                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Verified Gross Mass (VGM)** | Total weight of the container + cargo + packaging. <br> Mandatory for safety to avoid overloading.                                                               |
| **Unit vs Container**         | - **Unit** = One item handled separately. <br> - **Container** = Big box carrying items. Becomes a **unit** when moved in/out of terminal.                       |
| **Transaction Cycle**         | Steps a container goes through during entry/exit. <br> Changes its status and makes it trackable as a **unit**.                                                  |
| **Attributes of a Unit**      | - **Category** = Cargo type (import/export). <br> - **Visit State** = Tracks where it is (entered, in yard, exiting). <br> - **Transit State** = Movement stage. |
| **Gate Configuration**        | Gate is set up in **stages**: <br> - Engaged Stage <br> - Pedestal Stage <br> - Yard Stage <br> - Appointment Stage <br> Each has its own **transactions**.      |
| **Gate Operations**           | - **Appointments** help manage truck flow. <br> - **Truck IDs** track entries and exits. <br> - Transactions include container pickup, delivery, etc.            |
| **Turn Time (TT)**            | Time a truck spends inside the terminal. <br> Helps measure terminal productivity. Shorter TT = better efficiency.                                               |
